The intent that I decided to build the blog is that I bought several technique books and want to spend a little spare time to improve myself. But I realize that just reading may not a good way to learn. The best way is to combine input and output, reading and writing, learning and teaching. So I set up the blog to record something from what I have learned. This blog is used to record what I have learned from books and daily work(unclassified). Maybe I will also put something about my life and my dog on it in future. I don’t like to and will not spread it, so maybe I am the only user and reader of this blog. At last, I set up this blog with hexo, using github as the server and the storage. I will talk about how it was built in next blog.","tags":[{"name":"hello-blog","slug":"hello-blog","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/hello-blog/"}]},{"title":"Hello World","date":"2017-06-03T09:22:31.000Z","path":"2017/06/03/hello-world/","text":"Welcome to Hexo!
